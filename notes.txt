/** Require Gmail OAUTH2 as package dependency ================================ */
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
composer require league/oauth2-client, if composer.json is empty, but i've added
to repo.

>> Just run composer install inside PHPMailer dir.

NOTE: Requires PHP 5.5 or later.

/** Configure an OAuth2 app =================================================== */
>> Login to google account for email addr that will be used for SMTP relay.
>> Go to developer console. (https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
>> Click "Create Project" under the Project pull-down at the top of the page where
   the "Google APIs" logo is.
>> Give the Project a name, can be anything, i.e. PHPMailer. Then click Create.
>> Go to Library and select 'Gmail API' and Enable it.
>> Select 'Create Credentials'
>> Google will try to ask questions to figure out what you need, but skip that
   and select 'client ID'.
>> Google will ask you to set a product name on the consent screen. Select
   'Configure consent screen'.
>> Should auto-fill your Gmail addr. All fields are optional except the Product
   Name field, which can be set to sorcmon, or whatever. Does not have to be
   PHPMailer or sorcmon. Click 'Save'.
>> Go to Dashboard and select Gmail API under your APIs at the bottom of the
   screen and then select 'Create Credentials'.
>> Select client ID again. Choose 'Web application' for Application Type.
>> Name = sorcmon (or whatever). Leave the Authorized JavaScript origins blank.
>> Add URL for sorcmon to Authorized redirect URIs
   http://localhost/sorcmon/get_oauth_token.php -> click 'Create'.
>> Google will show you your generated 'client ID' and 'client secret'.

NOTE: Next step will need to be updated for sorcmon to use scratch/config.json.

>> Copy and paste the credentials into get_auth_token.php
    $redirectUri = 'http://localhost/phpmailer/get_oauth_token.php';
    $clientId = '237644427849-g8d0pnkd1jh3idcjdbopvkse2hvj0tdp.apps.googleusercontent.com';
    $clientSecret = 'mklHhrns6eF-qjwuiLpSB4DL';

/** Fetch the token =========================================================== */
>> Paste the script URL into a web browser and select Google ID.
>> Not able to do this since I am running in a terminal!
>> sudo apt-get install w3m w3m-img (this was already installed on scotch-box)
>> w3m <url>
NOTE: w3m does not support JS so this doesn't help me.
>> sudo apt-get install lynx
>> sudo apt-get install links
>> lynx http://localhost/PHPMailer/get_oauth_token.php
>> stuck at getting a refresh token. cannot get with lynx or w3m!

NOTE: May be able to gain OAUTH creds via an API client tool
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer

NOTE: None of the existing cli browsers that I have tested support JS.
      Google is disabling the Submit button so that a browser is needed.
      For this reason, I will have to use Ubuntu on a VM for testing and
      hopefully can port over to Rasbian on an rPi Mail Server.
